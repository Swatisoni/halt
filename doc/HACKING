You can use the makefile to set up the base images needed for emulation.

    make vboximage

This creates a .img and a .vdi. If the .img exists, the .vdi will be recreated. To mount it up as a loopback device, run

    make mount

This mounts up the .img as loop in PROJECT_ROOT/mnt, meaning writing to that dir updates the .img directly. This makes it easy to deploy new builds of the kernel to the disk.

Create a Virtualbox VM that has uefi enabled and boot from the .vdi disk created by the makefile.
